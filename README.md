## Key Features and Technical Capabilities

- **Interactive Help**: Provides detailed help and usage instructions for all available commands.
- **Code Analysis**: Generates comprehensive summaries of the project's structure, dependencies, and more.
- **Readme Generation**: Automatically generates a README.md file for your project, which can be previewed before saving.
- **Dependency Management**: Manages project dependencies through tools like `pip` and `setuptools`.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Uses a rich text interface to display information and interact with the user.

## Usage Instructions with Examples

### Generating README.md

To generate a comprehensive README.md file for your project, use the following command:

```sh
python main.py readme
```

This will create a `README.md` file in your project directory. You can preview it before saving by using the `--preview` option:

```sh
python main.py readme --preview
```

### Analyzing Dependencies

```sh
python main.py analyze
```

This will provide a detailed summary of the project's dependencies and their versions.

### Getting Help for Commands

To get help on any command, use the `--help` option followed by the command name. For example:

```sh
python main.py ask --help
```
